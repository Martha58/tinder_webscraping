# Project Idea: Tinder Webscraping Bot

I created a webscraping bot using Selenium that automates the process of logging into Tinder, navigating user profiles, and extracting profile data such as names, age, bio, interests, and images. Organize each profileâ€™s details into individual folders, storing text data and images separately for easy access.

# Key Features:

* Automate login and navigation using different authentication methods.

* Scrape multiple profiles efficiently, with a set limit for testing purposes.

* Save each profile's data in a structured folder format for organized storage.

# Challenges to Address:

* Bypassing anti-scraping measures to avoid bans.

* Handling dynamic elements with WebDriverWait for stable performance.

# End Goal: 

A fully automated bot that can scrape profile details across different regions (with VPN integration) and save them in a structured format for further analysis.
